#This code imports the calendar module, which provides functions to work with calendars.

import calendar

#The code prompts the user to enter a year for which they want to generate a calendar. The input is stored in the variable 'year'.

year = input('Enter year of calendar')
year = int(year)

#Then, it checks if the entered year is less than 2000 or greater than 3000. 

#If the condition is true, it prints 'Invalid year' to indicate that the entered year is not within the valid range.

if year < 2000 or year > 3000:
  
  #If the year is valid, it calls the calendar function with the year as an argument to generate a calendar for that year. 
  
  #The calendar function returns a multi-line string representing the calendar. 
  
  print('Invalid year')
else:
  
  #Finally, it prints the generated calendar to the console.
  
  print(calendar.calendar(year))

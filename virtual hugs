#In honor of Mental Health Awareness month I created this code <3

#The 'import time' statement imports the 'time' module, which provides functions to handle time-related operations.

import time

#The 'send_hugs()' function is defined. It contains a series of print statements and 'time.sleep()' function calls to simulate the process of sending virtual hugs.

def send_hugs():
    
    #The first print statement displays the message "Press Enter to receive a virtual hug..." to prompt the user to press the Enter key.
    
    print("Press Enter to receive a virtual hug...")
    
    #The 'input()' function is used to wait for the user to press the Enter key. It will pause the program's execution until the Enter key is pressed.
    
    input()
    print("Sending virtual hugs!")
    
    #The time.sleep(1) function call pauses the program's execution for 1 second, creating a brief delay before printing each letter of "HUGS!".
    
    #After the user presses Enter, the program continues to the next line and prints "Sending virtual hugs!" to indicate that the hugs are being sent.
    
    time.sleep(1)
   print("H", end="")
   
   #Between each letter, there's a time.sleep(0.5) call that pauses the program's execution for 0.5 seconds, creating a slight delay between each letter.
   
   time.sleep(0.5)
    
    #The subsequent print statements use the end="" argument to ensure that each letter of "HUGS!" is printed on the same line without a newline character.
    
    print("U", end="")
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print("G", end="")
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print("S", end="")
    time.sleep(0.5)
  
  #Finally, the exclamation mark is printed, and the message "Hugs received. Sending love and positivity your way!" is displayed.
   
   print("!")
    print("Hugs received. Sending love and positivity your way!")

#The function send_hugs() is called at the end, which initiates the execution of the code inside the function.

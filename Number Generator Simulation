#This code I've created a program that simulates a random number generator.

#The code imports the random module, which provides functions for generating random numbers.

import random

#Next, there is a function named 'number_generator()' that generates a random number between 1 and 1000 using the 'randint()' function from the random module. 
#It prints a message indicating that it is picking a number and then returns the generated number.

def number_generator():
  
  print('Picking a number...')
  
  return random.randint(1,1000)


print('Welcome to my random number generator simulator!')

#The program then prompts the user for their name and greets them with a personalized message.

name = input('What is your name? ')

print('Hello '+ name)

#Inside the 'while' loop, the program waits for the user to press enter to generate a random number or type "quit" to exit the program.

while True:

#When the user presses enter, the number_result variable is assigned the result of calling the number_generator() function, generating a random number.

   input(name+' '+'press enter to receive a number, or type quit to exit...')
   
   number_result = number_generator()
 
#Finally, the program prints the user's name along with the generated number.

#The loop continues until the user types "quit" to exit the program.
  
  print(name+' '+ 'your number is', number_result)
